# Wayfair Listing Spreadsheet Generator

Desktop app for generating Wayfair listing spreadsheets for print products such as decals and wallpapers.

The project is built with Flet, writes `.xlsx` files with `openpyxl`, and includes gettext-based localization for English, Russian, Ukrainian, and Albanian.

## Features

- Generate Wayfair-ready spreadsheets from a desktop form
- Support different product shaping flows for decals and wallpapers
- Use the bundled Excel template from `assets/template.xlsx`
- Switch the app language in the UI
- AI-assisted title and keyword generation via Google Gemini (optional)
- Remembers the last save folder across sessions
- Price data is prefetched in the background at startup to avoid delays on first submission
- Manage translations with Babel and Makefile helpers
- Run linting and static type checks with Ruff and MyPy
- Build desktop bundles for macOS and Windows with Flet

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- For macOS builds: full Xcode installation, not only Command Line Tools
- For Windows builds from macOS/Linux: Flet/Flutter build prerequisites as required by the target platform

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FunkyDrama/WayfairFlatMakerByDK.git
cd WayfairFlatMakerByDK
poetry install
```

## Run The App

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

## AI Integration (optional)

The app can suggest a listing title and keyword phrase by analyzing the first product image with Google Gemini.

To enable:

1. Create a `.env` file with your API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Place it in the appropriate location:

| Mode | Location |
|------|----------|
| Development | project root (next to `main.py`) |
| `flet build` macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/com.funkydrama.wayfairflatmakerbydk/` |
| `flet build` Windows | `%APPDATA%\com.funkydrama.wayfairflatmakerbydk\` |
| `flet pack` (PyInstaller) | next to the executable |

2. Optionally override the model (default is `gemini-2.5-flash`):

```env
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

When configured, a **✨ Suggest title & keywords** button appears on the form. The button is active only when the first image URL is filled and a print type is selected. Clicking it sends the image to Gemini and fills in the title and keyword fields.

Settings are loaded from the `.env` file via `app/settings.py` using `pydantic-settings`.

```

## How It Works
1. The user selects a print type (decal or wallpaper).
2. Fill the app form with title, SKU, keywords, images, and sizes.
3. Optionally click **✨ Suggest title & keywords** to generate content with AI.
4. The app shapes the data for the selected print type.
5. A completed `.xlsx` file is generated into the selected folder.

Wayfair path:
`Product Management -> Add Products -> Standard -> Quick Upload`

## Makefile Commands

### Localization

```bash
make i18n-extract
make i18n-update
make i18n-compile
make i18n-init LANG=de
make i18n-all
```

What they do:

- `i18n-extract`: extract translatable strings into `locales/app.pot`
- `i18n-update`: update existing catalogs from the template
- `i18n-compile`: compile `.po` files into `.mo`
- `i18n-init LANG=de`: create a new locale scaffold
- `i18n-all`: update and compile in one run

### Quality Checks

```bash
make check
```

This runs:

- `poetry run ruff format`
- `poetry run ruff check --fix`
- `poetry run mypy --check-untyped-defs .`

### Builds

```bash
make build-macos
make build-windows
make build-windows-onefile
```

Notes:

- `build-macos` runs `poetry run flet build macos`
- `build-windows` runs `poetry run flet build windows`
- `build-windows-onefile` runs `flet pack` with bundled `assets` and `locales`

## Flet Build Configuration

Build metadata is defined in `pyproject.toml` under:

- `[tool.flet]`
- `[tool.flet.app]`
- `[tool.flet.app.startup_screen]`
- `[tool.flet.macos]`
- `[tool.flet.windows]`

Equivalent direct commands:

```bash
poetry run flet build macos
poetry run flet build windows
```

## Localization Notes

- Runtime translations are loaded from `locales/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/app.mo`
- Source catalogs live in `locales/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/app.po`
- `app/messages.py` intentionally keeps strings that Babel would not reliably extract from indirect call sites or constants
- Loaded translators are cached in memory so the `.mo` file is parsed only once per language per session

If you add new UI text:

1. Update code
2. Run `make i18n-update`
3. Fill `msgstr` in each locale
4. Run `make i18n-compile`

## Dependencies

Runtime dependencies:

- [`flet[all]`](https://pypi.org/project/flet/)
- [`openpyxl`](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/)
- [`babel`](https://pypi.org/project/babel/)
- [`watchdog`](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/)
- [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/) — Gemini AI SDK
- [`pydantic-settings`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-settings/) — `.env`-based config

Dev dependencies:

- [`ruff`](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/)
- [`mypy`](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)

## Type Checking

Static typing is enabled and verified with:

```bash
poetry run mypy app data i18n main.py
```

`openpyxl` is configured via a MyPy override in `pyproject.toml` because type stubs are not installed for that library in this project.

## Notes About The Excel Template

The generated file is based on the bundled Wayfair template in `assets/template.xlsx`.

If some cells are protected in Excel or Google Sheets after generation, that comes from the template itself rather than from the export logic. The app writes values into the workbook but does not remove worksheet protection.
